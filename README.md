CueKeeper
=========

Copyright Thomas Leonard, 2017

CueKeeper is a web-based [GTD][] system (a fancy TODO list) that runs entirely in your browser (the data is stored on your computer, in your browser).

Installation
------------

Download the latest `cuekeeper-bin` zip from the [releases list][], e.g.

https://github.com/talex5/cuekeeper/releases/download/v0.2/cuekeeper-bin-0.2.zip

Extract it somewhere permanent (not your Downloads folder) and open the `index.html` file inside in a web browser. Most browsers will allow you to "pin" the tab so that it is always available. e.g. In Firefox, right-click on the browser tab and choose "Pin Tab" from the menu. The tab icon will go red when something becomes due.

Instructions for using CueKeeper can be found here:

Backups
-------

All data will be stored locally in your web browser, so make sure you're backing up your browser's data! Also, the data will be stored based on the location of the `index.html` file - if you move the `cuekeeper` directory, you will get a fresh database (and it will look as if your data has gone - don't panic!).

For example, I use Firefox on Linux. The data is stored at

    ~/.mozilla/firefox/XXX.default/storage/default/file++++home+user+cuekeeper+index.html/


Building (using Docker)
-----------------------

The easiest way to build CueKeeper is using Docker:

    make docker-build

Then load `test.html` in a browser to test locally (no server required).


Building (without Docker)
-------------------------

You'll need the [opam](http://opam.ocaml.org/) package manager.
It should be available through your distribution, but you can use a [generic opam binary](http://tools.ocaml.org/opam.xml) if it's missing or too old (I use opam 1.2.2).
Ensure you're using OCaml 4.03 or later (check with `ocaml -version`). If not, switch to that version:

    opam sw 4.03.0

Pin a few patches we require:

    opam pin add -n reactiveData https://github.com/hhugo/reactiveData.git
    opam pin add -n bin_prot 'https://github.com/talex5/bin_prot.git#cuekeeper'

    opam update

Install the dependencies:

    opam install sexplib uuidm irmin tyxml reactiveData js_of_ocaml omd base64 tar-format crunch cohttp irmin-indexeddb ounit mirage-http tar

Build:

    make

Load `test.html` in a browser to test locally (no server required).


Running a server
----------------

While `test.html` can be opened directly in a browser, as above, you can also build a server.
This allows you to sync between devices (e.g. a laptop and mobile phone).

**Warning: This is a work-in-progress**:

- The server does not yet persist the data itself
  (the client sends the whole history the first time it connects after the service is restarted).
- You have to sync manually by clicking the `Sync` button - it does not send or fetch changes automatically.
- You must use Irmin 0.10.1, due to https://github.com/talex5/irmin-indexeddb/issues/3.

First, generate an access token (a *long* random string that grants access to the server).
The `pwgen` command is useful for this:

    $ pwgen -s 32 1
    dtXZ7fQfX52VsnJNk22J6uKy8JSn6klb

To avoid storing the secret in the server binary, generate its SHA256 hash:

    $ echo -n dtXZ7fQfX52VsnJNk22J6uKy8JSn6klb | sha256sum
    774400f3384a6f37cc2bc54b2fd0280193b613a5bc401c0e54fd17fe4ec19572

Copy the file `server/devices.ml.example` as `server/devices.ml` and add the hash
you generated above, e.g.:

    let lookup = function
      | "774400f3384a6f37cc2bc54b2fd0280193b613a5bc401c0e54fd17fe4ec19572" -> Some "Laptop"
      | _ -> None

The string at the end ("Laptop") is just used for logging.
You can generate a different access token for each device you want to sync and list them all here, one per line.
Make sure the `None` line comes last - this rejects all unknown tokens.

To build the server component:

    opam install mirage
    make server

You will be prompted to create a self-signed X.509 certificate. Just enter your server's hostname
as the "Common Name" (for testing, you could use "localhost" here and generate a proper one later).

To run the server:

    ./server/mir-cuekeeper

By default the server listens on TCP port 8443, but this can be changed by editing `server/unikernel.ml`.

Open the URL in a browser, e.g.

    https://localhost:8443/

You'll probably now get some scary-looking warning about the certificate not being trusted.
To get rid of the warning, add your newly-generated server.pem as follows:

In Firefox:

1. Firefox will say "This Connection is Untrusted".
2. Expand the **I Understand the Risks** section.
3. Click **Add Exception**, then **Confirm Security Exception** (and "Permanently store this exception").

In Chrome:

1. It will say "Your connection is not private" (in fact, the opposite is true; if encryption wasn't being used it wouldn't have complained at all).
2. Go to **Settings** -> **Show advanced settings**.
3. Click the **Manage certificates** button (in the HTTPS/SSL section).
4. In the **Authorities** tab, click **Import...** and select your `server/conf/server.pem` file.
5. Select **Trust this certificate for identifying websites**.

Finally, you should be prompted for your access key.
Paste in the token you generated above (e.g. `dtXZ7fQfX52VsnJNk22J6uKy8JSn6klb` in the example above - *not* the hash).

Deploying as a Xen VM
---------------------

In fact, the server is a [Mirage unikernel][mirage] and can also be compiled and booted as a Xen virtual machine:

    make server MIRAGE_FLAGS="--xen"
    cd server
    xl create -c cuekeeper.xl
